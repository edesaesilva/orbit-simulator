# Orbit Simulator

This is a tool for visualizing simple solar systems of stars, planets, and rocks.

App has been tested from PyCharm, so I recommend running GUI.py from there.

Position, mass, and radius data can be written to and read from .json files, as well as written to .csv files from within the app.

Some steps of the simulation take some time, so take some time to grab coffee while it runs :)
